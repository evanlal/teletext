/* Unit Testing */
For checking that the block graphics render correctly, I performed unit testing.
I passed different values to the init_block_graphic function and used assertions to determine that the correct sixels were lit.




/* Memory Checks */
I checked that I always free allocating memory.
- Closing the file after tokenizing.
- Freeing the TokenStream after convertion to Teletext, even though I kept the tokens inside the teletext for debugging purposes.
- Freeing teletext after window close. For this I first had to free each token and block graphic.

At first I got a memory error after attempting to terminate the program. So I used Valgrind to check for memory leaks and related errors.
The cause of that error was that I was attempting to double free some block graphics, because when in hold mode I just pointed control code to the most recent graphic.
I fixed that by allocating new space for each block graphic in hold mode and memcpy the most recent graphic.

Further checkings with valgrind revealed leaks and other error seemingly coming from the SDL implmentation.
